## Does this plugin replace the official JavaFX plugin?

No, this plugin is an alternative to the official JavaFX plugin. It is designed for a better
configuration, but it does not attempt at any time to replace the official plugin.

## Does this plugin do the same as `io.github.ushiosan23.custom_jfx_plugin`?

Yes, since really that account and this is the same person who made the plugin. Only that specific version
had many problems performing a clean refactoring and I decided to create the plugin from scratch taking
many concepts from that plugin.

## Add more functionality to the plugin?

At the moment, I think the plugin has everything it needs to work on any project. Likewise, if a certain
functionality is required, you can make a pull request with the desired functionality or create an issue
with the precise functionality you are looking for. It is not certain that it will be implemented, but it
will be taken into account for future versions.
